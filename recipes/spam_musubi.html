    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Spam is a canned meat made mostly with ham. When I lived in Hawaii, I had Spam all the time, mainly because it was pretty much all I could afford. I had it for breakfast with eggs and rice and dinner with noodles and rice. And for lunch, I made this Spam Musubi. You can buy Spam Musubi in Hawaii at any grocery store or gas station. On the mainland, it is available in most grocery stores where you buy canned meats.</p>
    <p><strong>Prep Time: 25 mins</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Cook Time: 5 mins</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Total Time: 30 mins</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Servings: 8</strong></p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>12 oz Spam</li>
        <li>1/4 cup oyster sauce</li>
        <li>1/4 cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>1/2 cup sugar</li>
        <li>Nori roasted seaweed, cut into halves or thirds</li>
        <li>6 cups cooked sushi rice</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Slice the SPAM into about 8-10 slices (depending on how thick you like it) and put in a Ziplock bag. Mix oyster sauce, soy sauce, and sugar until sugar is dissolved and add to the bag with the SPAM. Marinate for about 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Drain off marinade and fry SPAM on each side over medium heat until slightly crispy or until desired doneness. Some people like to glaze the SPAM with the marinade/sauce AFTER frying, either way tastes great!</li>
        <li>Place a strip of nori on a cutting board or clean surface (shiny side down). Place your Musubi mold across the middle of the nori. Add Sushi Rice to the mold, pressing down firmly and evenly so there is about 1-1 Â½ inches of rice. Dip the mold and your fingers in water as you go to prevent sticking.</li>
        <li>Next, remove the mold from the rice. Now you will have a nice little block of rice right on the nori. Add some of the cooked SPAM to the top. Wrap up one side of the nori and stick it to the top of the SPAM, then wrap up the other side. Just like you are wrapping a nice little package. Use a little water on your finger to seal if needed. Serve warm.</li>
        <li>Some like it dipped in soy sauce, some like it with ketchup, and some like it as is.</li>
    </ol>
